      <h1>What is RoadLoop?</h1>
      <p>
        RoadLoop is a driver-centric platform built around three pillars:
        <strong>Driver analytics</strong>, <strong>Vehicle profiles</strong>, and <strong>Segments</strong>.
        The goal is to make driving more informed, more organised, and more fun — while staying privacy-first.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Driver Profile & Mileage Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        RoadLoop automatically detects journeys and builds an understanding of your mileage and driving patterns.
        Each trip can be tagged with a confidence score, and you can delete trips you don’t want to keep.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Vehicle Profiles</h2>
      <p>
        Add your vehicles and keep them organised: odometer tracking, service history, and reminders for things like
        MOT/tax/insurance. The aim is to reduce admin and make “ownership hygiene” effortless.
      </p>

      <h2>3) Segments</h2>
      <p>
        Segments are the social/competitive layer: curated stretches of road you can compare performance on.
        We’re cautious with social features — we focus on visibility through segments and achievements rather than
        publishing full journeys.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        RoadLoop offers tiers that control segment usage and premium dashboards. Some dashboards and analytics
        are behind a paywall, and early “VIP” access may be offered for the first cohort of users.
