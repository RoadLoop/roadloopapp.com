      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        RoadLoop (“we”, “us”) helps drivers track mileage, manage vehicles, and compete via segments.
        This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and the choices you have.
      </p>

      <h2>Data we may collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email address and basic profile details (if you create an account).</li>
        <li><strong>Journey data:</strong> location points and timestamps used to detect trips and produce insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle data:</strong> vehicle profiles you add (e.g. nickname, odometer, service notes).</li>
        <li><strong>Segment activity:</strong> segment attempts and related performance metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and diagnostics:</strong> app version, device type, and crash/diagnostic events to improve reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use your data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core functionality (journey detection, mileage analytics, vehicle tracking, segments).</li>
        <li>Improve accuracy and user experience (e.g. confidence scoring, quality improvements).</li>
        <li>Operate subscriptions and entitlements (if you purchase premium features).</li>
        <li>Prevent abuse and keep the service secure.</li>
        <li>Debug issues and monitor app reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Location data</h2>
      <p>
        Location is used to detect and record journeys and to power map/routing features.
        You can control location permissions in your device settings. RoadLoop may also provide controls in-app
        to delete journeys you don’t want to keep.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing and visibility</h2>
      <p>
        RoadLoop is designed to avoid unnecessary sharing. Competitive and social features are based around
        segments and achievements rather than publishing complete journey traces by default.
      </p>

      <h2>Deletion and control</h2>
      <p>
        You can delete journeys and manage vehicle profiles within the app. If you delete data, we aim to remove it
        from our active systems, though limited copies may remain temporarily in backups for security and reliability.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use trusted providers to run the app (hosting, analytics, crash reporting, subscriptions, mapping/routing).
        These providers process data on our behalf and are required to protect it.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain data only as long as needed to provide the service, comply with legal obligations,
        and support security and troubleshooting.
      </p>
